git push -u origin main
```

2. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
3. Click "New Project"
4. Import your GitHub repo
5. Set **Root Directory** to: `apps/web`

```

2. Drag and drop the `dist` folder to [netlify.com/drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop)

## 🔧 Environment Variables (Optional)

If you want to connect to a backend API later:
- Add `VITE_API_URL=https://your-api-url.com` in your deployment settings

## 📱 Features Available

Your deployed app will have:
- ✅ URL shortening (local storage mode)
- ✅ Analytics dashboard
- ✅ QR code generation
- ✅ Dark/light mode
- ✅ Workspace management
- ✅ AI integration (with API key)

## 🔗 Demo Mode

Without a backend, the app runs in "demo mode":
- URLs are stored in browser localStorage
- Perfect for showcasing the UI/UX
- All features work except actual URL redirection
- Great for portfolio/demo purposes

## 🚀 Quick Deploy Commands

```bash
# Option 1: Vercel
cd apps/web && npx vercel

# Option 2: Build for any static hosting
cd apps/web && npm run build
# Then upload the 'dist' folder to any static hosting service
```

## 🎉 That's it!

Your ShortLink Pro is ready to go live! The app will work beautifully as a frontend-only demo, and you can always add the backend API later.
